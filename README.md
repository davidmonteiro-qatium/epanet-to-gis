# EPANET to GIS

Create Shapefiles or GeoJSON files of an EPANET hydraulic model. Either drag an INP into the drop zone below or click the area to open a prompt to select the file. All geoprocessing is done locally and no data is sent to the server.

The app uses [epanet-js](https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js), a javascript conversion of the owa-epanet library.
